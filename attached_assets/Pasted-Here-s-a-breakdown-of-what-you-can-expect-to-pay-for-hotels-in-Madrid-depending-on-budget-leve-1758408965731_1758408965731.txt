Here’s a breakdown of what you can expect to pay for hotels in **Madrid** — depending on budget level (low / budget, mid-range, luxury). Prices are approximate, per night, and can vary greatly with season, location (central vs outskirts), and how far in advance you book.

| Tier                  | Approx Price (US\$)                                | What you typically get                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low / Budget**      | **US\$ 40–80**                                     | Basic hotels, hostels or 1-2 star places. Often small rooms, fewer amenities. Good for short stays or just sleeping. Locations may be a bit away from the prime center. ([KAYAK][1])                              |
| **Mid-Range**         | **US\$ 90–180**                                    | 3-star or lower 4-star hotels in quite good locations. More amenities (breakfast, maybe a nicer lobby, better service). Better decor, more comfort. ([Budget Your Trip][2])                                       |
| **Luxury / High-End** | **US\$ 200–500+** (and much more in top-end cases) | 5-star hotels, premium boutique hotels, excellent locations. Deluxe rooms, high end services (spa, gourmet restaurants, rooftop bars etc.). Some ultra-luxury or iconic hotels may cost much more. ([trivago][3]) |
