Short answer: **paginate (or infinite-scroll “paging”)—don’t dump everything on one screen.**

Here’s the quick decision:

# Recommendation

Use **paged loading with infinite scroll** for the main results and a **“Load more” fallback button**. Keep each page small (≈8 cards). This gives you fast first paint, predictable API cost, and smoother UX—exactly what you need given flight lookups.

# Why this beats one giant screen

* **Speed:** You can **stop after the first 8** (abort the rest) and show results in \~8–12s, then fetch page 2 only if the user scrolls.
* **Cost & stability:** Limits Amadeus calls per view; easier to cache `(origin,dest,month,page)` slices.
* **Memory/JS footprint:** Fewer DOM nodes; smoother scrolling, especially on mobile.
* **UX control:** You can reorder later pages, down-rank timeouts, and avoid blocking on slow cities.

# Practical defaults (copy to your spec)

* **limit:** 8 per page (can A/B 6 or 10).
* **max pages returned:** cap at 5–6 pages (48 total) to prevent runaway queries.
* **API contract:** `/api/travel/recs?limit=8&page=1&...` returns `{ results, nextPage, partial }`.
* **Early stop:** once `results.length === limit`, **abort in-flight tasks** for that page.
* **Prefetch:** when the user hits 70–80% scroll, request `nextPage` (show 2–3 skeleton cards).
* **Fallback:** show a **“Load more”** button if IntersectionObserver fails or bandwidth is poor.
* **Sticky filters:** keep tier/budget/month in query params so page 2+ matches page 1.
* **Caps:** if nothing new after 2 timeouts, short-circuit the nextPage with a friendly message.

# Nice extras

* **“View all (table)”**: provide a compact table modal for power users to scan many cities quickly (still page the data under the hood).
* **Retry line-items:** let users re-try a single failed city card without refetching the whole page.
* **Telemetry:** log TTFP (time to first page), page-1 success rate, cache hit rate, abort count.

If you want a one-liner for Replit Agent:
“Implement **paged results with infinite scroll**: backend honors `limit/page` with **early stop + abort**, frontend loads 8 cards, **prefetches nextPage**, shows a **Load more** fallback, and preserves filters across pages.”
